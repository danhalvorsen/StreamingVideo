# Streaming Video over SSH Secure Channel

## Summary

Streaming video over a secure channel
It looks like you might be referring to configuring SSL with `ffmpeg`, a tool often used for video processing and streaming. If you're working with `ffmpeg` and need to enable SSL for secure connections, you will need to ensure that your `ffmpeg` is built with SSL support.

Here’s how to check if your `ffmpeg` has SSL support and how to enable it:

### 1. **Check SSL Support in `ffmpeg`:**

   To see if `ffmpeg` was built with SSL support, run:

   ```bash
   ffmpeg -buildconf | grep ssl
   ```

   If SSL is supported, you’ll see output indicating that libraries like `openssl` are included.

### 2. **Install `ffmpeg` with SSL Support:**

   If SSL support is not included, you might need to install a version that includes it. Here’s how you can install it:

- **For Ubuntu/Debian:**

     ```bash
     sudo apt-get update
     sudo apt-get install ffmpeg libssl-dev
     ```

- **Building `ffmpeg` with SSL:**
     If you need to build `ffmpeg` from source with SSL support:

     ```bash
     sudo apt-get install build-essential yasm pkg-config libssl-dev
     git clone https://git.ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg.git
     cd ffmpeg
     ./configure --enable-openssl
     make
     sudo make install
     ```

### 3. **Using SSL with `ffmpeg`:**

   When using `ffmpeg` to access HTTPS streams or RTMP with TLS/SSL, use URLs with the `https` or `rtmps` scheme, like this:

   ```bash
   ffmpeg -i https://example.com/stream.m3u8 -c copy output.mp4
   ```

   For RTMP streams over SSL:

   ```bash
   ffmpeg -i rtmps://example.com/live/stream -c copy output.flv
   ```

This should help you set up `ffmpeg` for working with secure connections. If you encounter any specific issues or errors, feel free to share them for more tailored guidance!


### In order to get access to a Linux machine and "Nice" I will use run the concept as Docker Containers

To ensure NVIDIA GPU support with `ffmpeg` in a Docker container using Docker Compose, you'll need to use the NVIDIA Docker runtime and ensure that the `ffmpeg` build supports NVIDIA hardware acceleration (e.g., using CUDA, NVENC/NVDEC). Here's how to set this up:

### Prerequisites

1. **NVIDIA Drivers**: Make sure that NVIDIA drivers are installed on your host machine.
2. **NVIDIA Container Toolkit**: Install the NVIDIA Container Toolkit to enable Docker to use the GPU.

   To install the NVIDIA Container Toolkit, follow these steps:

   ```bash
   distribution=$(. /etc/os-release;echo $ID$VERSION_ID)
   curl -s -L https://nvidia.github.io/nvidia-docker/gpgkey | sudo apt-key add -
   curl -s -L https://nvidia.github.io/nvidia-docker/$distribution/nvidia-docker.list | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/nvidia-docker.list
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install -y nvidia-docker2
   sudo systemctl restart docker
   ```

### Step 1: Create a Dockerfile

This Dockerfile will ensure `ffmpeg` is built with NVIDIA support, including NVENC (NVIDIA Encoder).

```dockerfile
# Use an NVIDIA base image with CUDA support
FROM nvidia/cuda:12.0-runtime-ubuntu22.04

# Install dependencies
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    build-essential \
    yasm \
    pkg-config \
    libssl-dev \
    wget \
    git \
    && apt-get clean

# Install ffmpeg with NVENC support
RUN git clone https://git.ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg.git /ffmpeg
WORKDIR /ffmpeg
RUN ./configure \
    --enable-cuda \
    --enable-cuvid \
    --enable-nvenc \
    --enable-nonfree \
    --enable-libnpp \
    --extra-cflags=-I/usr/local/cuda/include \
    --extra-ldflags=-L/usr/local/cuda/lib64 \
    --enable-openssl && \
    make -j$(nproc) && \
    make install

# Clean up the build files to reduce image size
WORKDIR /
RUN rm -rf /ffmpeg

# Set up entrypoint to use ffmpeg directly
ENTRYPOINT ["ffmpeg"]
```

### Step 2: Create a `docker-compose.yml` File

This `docker-compose.yml` file will configure the container to use the NVIDIA runtime:

```yaml
version: '3.9'

services:
  ffmpeg:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    runtime: nvidia
    environment:
      - NVIDIA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=all  # Adjust this if you want to specify which GPUs to use
      - NVIDIA_DRIVER_CAPABILITIES=compute,video,utility
    volumes:
      - ./data:/data  # Adjust the path as needed to store input/output files
    command: ["-version"]  # Example command to test ffmpeg; replace with your own
```

### Step 3: Build and Run the Docker Container

1. Make sure both the Dockerfile and `docker-compose.yml` are in the same directory.
2. Build the Docker image using:

   ```bash
   docker-compose build
   ```

3. Start the container using:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

   This will launch the container, and it will run the `ffmpeg -version` command to confirm that `ffmpeg` is installed. Replace the command with your actual `ffmpeg` commands as needed.

### Step 4: Using `ffmpeg` with NVIDIA Acceleration

Once the container is running, you can use NVIDIA-accelerated `ffmpeg` commands. For example, to encode a video using NVENC:

```bash
docker-compose run ffmpeg -hwaccel cuda -i /data/input.mp4 -c:v h264_nvenc /data/output.mp4
```

In this command:
- `-hwaccel cuda` tells `ffmpeg` to use CUDA for hardware acceleration.
- `-c:v h264_nvenc` uses the NVIDIA encoder for H.264 encoding.
- Adjust `/data/input.mp4` and `/data/output.mp4` paths as needed.

### Step 5: Verifying GPU Usage

To verify that `ffmpeg` is using the GPU, you can use `nvidia-smi` on your host machine while the `ffmpeg` command is running:

```bash
watch -n 1 nvidia-smi
```

This command will show the GPU usage in real-time, allowing you to verify that the `ffmpeg` container is utilizing the GPU.

### Summary

- The `nvidia/cuda` base image includes the necessary CUDA libraries for hardware acceleration.
- The Dockerfile configures `ffmpeg` with NVENC support.
- `docker-compose.yml` enables the NVIDIA runtime for Docker, allowing the container to access the GPU.
- `ffmpeg` commands with `-hwaccel cuda` and `-c:v h264_nvenc` utilize GPU acceleration for video processing.

With this setup, you can take advantage of GPU acceleration in your `ffmpeg` Docker container for faster video encoding and processing.
